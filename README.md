# Reconhecimento-de-padroes-imagens-de-textos - Optical Character Recognition(OCR) for Robotic Decision-Making

This project involves the development of a robotic system integrated with an image processing server. The system's core functionality lies in its ability to make decisions based on text recognition from images captured by a digital camera mounted on the robot.

The project's primary components include:

- **Robot:** Based around a RaspberryPI, 2 motors, an H-Bridge, and a Camera Module.
- **Image Processing Server:** An image processing server that detects the text contained in images received from the robot, interprets them and sends commands back to the robot. Implemented with the TCP networking protocol.
